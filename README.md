# 1st semester python project at ECE upatras
## Implementation of various single and parallel sorting algoritms in Python

## To do:
1. Sort algoritmhs implementation:
- Bubble sort/Parallel bubble sort
- odd-even transposition sort
- Mergesort/Parallel mergesort
- quicksort and partitioning schemes                     
- Merging algorithms: odd-even merge/parallel odd-even merge
- bitonic mergesort

2. UI implementation:
- Choose the algorithm you want to use
- Show stats like (1) time, (2) number of processes (would be better if it had core utilization too ?), (3) batch size (WARNING: batch size will be large)
